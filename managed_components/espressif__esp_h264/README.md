# ESP_H264

- [![Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_h264/badge.svg)](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_h264)

ESP_H264 is Espressif's lightweight H.264 encoder and decoder component, offering both hardware and software implementations. The hardware encoder (HW encoder) is designed specifically for the ESP32-P4 chip, achieving a frame rate greater than 30fps for 1080P resolution images. The software encoder (SW encoder) is sourced from v2.2.0 of [openh264](https://github.com/cisco/openh264), while the decoder is obtained from [tinyH264](https://github.com/udevbe/tinyh264). Both the software encoder and decoder are optimized for memory and CPU usage, ensuring optimal performance on Espressif chips.

#### DECODER

Note: the memory consumption is strongly dependent on the resolution of H264 stream and the encoded data.

For the **mono task** decoder implementation, the performance is as follows:

| Resolution | Raw Format              | Memory (Byte) | Frame Per Second(fps) |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| 640 * 480  | ESP_H264_RAW_FMT_I420   | 2.5 M         | 9                     |
| 320 * 192  | ESP_H264_RAW_FMT_I420   | 1.0 M         | 23                    |

For the **dual task** decoder implementation, the performance is as follows:

| Resolution | Raw Format              | Memory (Byte) | Frame Per Second(fps) |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| 640 * 480  | ESP_H264_RAW_FMT_I420   | 2.5 M         | 11                    |

### Test on chip ESP32-P4

#### HW ENCODER

| Resolution  | Raw Format                    | Memory (Byte) | Frame Per Second(fps) |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| 1920 * 1080 | ESP_H264_RAW_FMT_O_UYY_E_VYY  | 140k          | 30                    |

Approximately:

The frame rate for a given resolution can be estimated as:
fps_cur ≈ fps_1080p × (current_resolution_pixels × bytes_per_pixel) ÷ (1920 × 1080 × bytes_per_pixel_1080p)

Where:
- fps_cur is the approximate frame rate for the current resolution
- fps_1080p is the frame rate for 1080p resolution
- current_resolution_pixels is the total number of pixels for the current resolution
- bytes_per_pixel is the number of bytes per pixel for the current resolution
- 1920 × 1080 is the number of pixels for 1080p resolution
- bytes_per_pixel_1080p is the number of bytes per pixel for 1080p

#### DECODER

Note: the memory consumption is strongly dependent on the resolution of H264 stream and the encoded data.

For the **mono task** decoder implementation, the performance is as follows:

| Resolution | Raw Format              | Memory (Byte) | Frame Per Second(fps) |

# FAQ

## Performance Issues

### Q: Why is decoding speed slow on ESP32-P4?

**A:** Decoding performance depends on several factors:

- **Resolution**: Higher resolutions require more processing power
- **Task configuration**: Use dual-task decoder for better performance
- **Memory allocation**: Ensure sufficient SPIRAM is available
- **Stream complexity**: Complex H.264 streams take more time to decode

**Performance optimization tips:**
- Use dual-task decoder implementation (configure task core and priority via menuconfig)
   ```
   ESP_H264_DECODER_IRAM=1
   ESP_H264_DUAL_TASK=1
   ```
- Lower resolution if possible (e.g., 640x480 instead of 1280x720)
- Ensure adequate memory allocation
- Check if the input H.264 stream uses the supported profile (constrained baseline)
